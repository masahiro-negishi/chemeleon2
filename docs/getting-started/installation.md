# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

## Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hspark1212/chemeleon2
cd chemeleon2

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync
```

:::{tip}
`uv sync` installs dependencies based on the `uv.lock` file, ensuring reproducible environments. If you encounter issues with `uv.lock` (e.g., lock file conflicts or compatibility problems), you can use the following alternative approach to install the package in editable mode directly from [`pyproject.toml`](../../pyproject.toml):
:::

```bash
# Create virtual environment and activate
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install package in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## CUDA Support

For efficient model training and inference, CUDA support is highly recommended. After completing `uv sync`, install a PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA environment to prevent compatibility issues.

For version-specific installation commands, visit the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).

```bash
# Example command for PyTorch 2.7.0 with CUDA 12.8
uv pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

## Optional Dependencies

### Development Tools

```bash
# Install development dependencies (pytest, ruff, pyright, etc.)
uv sync --extra dev # or uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Training Dependencies

```bash
# Install training dependencies for RL rewards (mace-torch, smact, etc.)
uv sync --extra training # or uv pip install -e ".[training]"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
pytest -v
```
