      # YAML file validation

# Note: pytest is intentionally excluded from pre-commit hooks
# Tests run in CI only to keep pre-commit fast (< 15 seconds target)

# ============================================================================
# Optional: Claude Code Auto-Fix Integration
# ============================================================================
# To enable automatic fixing of Ruff/pyright violations using Claude Code:
#
# 1. Install Claude Code CLI: https://claude.com/claude-code
# 2. Run the wrapper script when pre-commit fails:
#    ./scripts/claude-fix.sh
#
# Or run the auto-fix script directly:
#    ./.git-hooks/claude-autofix.sh
#
# The auto-fix tool will:
# - Attempt automatic fixes for Ruff violations
# - Run baseline tests to verify no regressions
# - Show you a diff of changes for review
#
# This is opt-in and does not block commits if you prefer manual fixes.
