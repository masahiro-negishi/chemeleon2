# Feature Specification: Development Workflow Standards for Team Collaboration

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-repository-was`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This repository was initially developed by me alone, but I'm preparing it for team collaboration. To support sustainable development, I'm introducing code formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks as part of the development workflow."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature confirmed: Development workflow standardization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Development team members, repository contributors
   → Actions: Code formatting, linting, pre-commit validation
   → Data: Source code, configuration files
   → Constraints: Must support team collaboration, sustainable development
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [RESOLVED: Use Ruff Format (Black-compatible) with integrated linting]
   → [RESOLVED: Apply strict linting rules with comprehensive checks]
   → [RESOLVED: Pre-commit hooks will block commits on failures]
   → [RESOLVED: Validate .py, .yaml, .toml, .json files]
   → [RESOLVED: Apply formatting retroactively to all existing code immediately]
   → [RESOLVED: No existing conventions to preserve, fresh migration to Ruff]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow identified: Developer makes code changes → Pre-commit validation → Commit/Push
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable via CI/CD or local validation
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Configuration files, validation rules, commit hooks
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All critical ambiguities resolved via clarification session
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: When code violates formatting or linting standards during a commit attempt, what should happen? → A: Block commit - Prevent commit entirely until issues are fixed (manually or via AI agent)
- Q: Which file types should be validated by the formatting and linting workflow? → A: Python + Config - `.py`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.json` files
- Q: Which Python code formatting standard should be enforced? → A: Ruff Format - Fast, Black-compatible formatting with integrated linting
- Q: What level of linting rule strictness should be applied? → A: Strict - Comprehensive checks (all moderate + docstrings, full type coverage, complexity limits, security patterns)
- Q: Should formatting and linting standards be applied retroactively to existing code already committed in the repository? → A: Yes, apply to all existing code immediately
- Q: Are there any existing code style conventions to preserve? → A: No, migrating from pylint to Ruff with fresh standards
- Q: How should new developers install and configure the pre-commit hooks? → A: One-command setup - Developers run a single setup command after cloning to install hooks automatically
- Q: What's the maximum acceptable time for pre-commit validation? → A: < 15 seconds - Moderate, acceptable for most workflows
- Q: Should AI coding agents be able to automatically fix pre-commit validation issues? → A: Yes, enable AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.) to fix formatting and linting issues automatically when requested
- Q: Should pytest be executed in pre-commit hooks? → A: No, CI only - Pre-commit excludes tests, CI/CD executes them
- Q: Should CI/CD pipeline automatically check formatting/linting? → A: GitHub Actions - PR checks required before merge
- Q: What level of developer documentation should be provided? → A: Full documentation - CONTRIBUTING.md, setup guide, AI agent usage
- Q: What line length and Python version should Ruff enforce? → A: 88 characters (Black default), Python 3.11+

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development team members contribute code to the repository with consistent formatting and quality standards. When a developer commits changes, automated checks validate code style, formatting, and quality standards before allowing the commit to proceed, ensuring all code in the repository maintains consistent standards without manual review overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the development workflow standards are established, **When** applied to the entire codebase with coordination to avoid active branch conflicts, **Then** all existing Python, YAML, TOML, and JSON files are reformatted and brought into compliance
2. **Given** a developer has modified Python source files, **When** they attempt to commit the changes, **Then** the code is automatically checked for formatting compliance and linting issues but tests are not executed
3. **Given** code that violates formatting standards, **When** a developer attempts to commit, **Then** the system blocks the commit and prevents it from proceeding until issues are fixed manually
4. **Given** pre-commit validation fails, **When** a developer requests an AI coding agent to fix the issues, **Then** the agent automatically corrects formatting and linting violations
5. **Given** a new team member clones the repository, **When** they set up their development environment, **Then** all formatting and linting standards are automatically configured
6. **Given** a developer opens a Pull Request, **When** GitHub Actions CI runs, **Then** formatting, linting, and all tests must pass before merge is allowed
7. **Given** a new contributor wants to understand the workflow, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** CONTRIBUTING.md provides setup instructions, coding standards, and AI agent usage guidance
8. **Given** properly formatted and linted code, **When** a developer commits changes, **Then** the commit proceeds without interruption
9. **Given** multiple developers working on different features, **When** they merge their code, **Then** all code follows the same formatting and style standards

### Edge Cases
- What happens when pre-commit hooks conflict with IDE auto-formatting settings?
- What happens when a developer bypasses pre-commit hooks (e.g., using `--no-verify`)?
- What happens when linting rules detect errors that cannot be auto-fixed?
- How does the system handle malformed YAML or JSON files that cannot be parsed?
- What happens if the initial formatting pass on all existing code creates merge conflicts with active feature branches?
- What happens when GitHub Actions fails but local pre-commit passes (environment differences)?
- How are CI/CD pipeline failures communicated to developers who are new to the workflow?
- How should retroactive formatting be applied when there are multiple open PRs to avoid conflicts?
- What happens when Ruff version differences between local and CI cause validation inconsistencies?
